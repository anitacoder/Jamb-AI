PREFACE                      
Since the conduct of the first Matriculation examination for entry into all Degree -awarding Institutions in 1978,  Colleges of Education in 1988, 
Colleges of Education & Polytechnics 1989, Monotechnics in 1998 and Innovation Enterprises Institutions in 2009 , the board has come a long way. 
The vision which foresaw that there would be a major increase in the number of applicants and the ability of each institution to handle admissions 
on its own soon became a reality as almost 40 years on, the numbers have reached a staggering 2 million applicants yearly. Surely the largest single 
application process for entry into educational institutions in the world since larger nations have regionalized the process.   
The Board has radically improved a lot of processes in the 2020 UTME and Direct Entry applications, the Brochure and Syllabus  were redesigned 
to improve richness of the look and feel, coupled with new media including videos, charts and links to various parts of the Brochure and Syllabus.   
This year, we have gone further to enhance the ability of the candidate to access the Integrated Brochure And Syllabus System  (IBASS) whilst 
increasing the channels of access and interraction. The interactive electronic c opy of the Brochure and Syllabus are now available on the JAMB 
website at www.jamb.gov.ng/ibass/ and can also be downloaded to Android smart phones using the link provided on the IBASS webpage above.   
JAMB also has noticed the inability of candidates to a ccurately identify the appropriate requirements for various Programmes of Study before 
filling the JAMB application forms. Also, one of the major improvements this year is the  ability of candidates to ident ify eligibility for various 
Programmes by supplying either O’Level or A’Level results into the eligibility form online on the IBASS link available on the JAMB website.   
In summary, the 2020 JAMB BROCHURE has the following features for the benefits of candidates:  
1. Online and mobile app (android) version apart from the CD version of the JAMB Brochure  
2. An interactive Eligibility Checker to guide candidates on institutions and courses they are eligible to apply for using their O’level or A’level 
subjects and UTME subjects.  
3. CBT Exams guide and Demo Exams to guide candidates on the process on the exams.  
4. Exams Rules and Regulations  
5. Recommended books  
6. Study tips and hints to guide candidates on how to prepare for the exams  
7. Contact offices, email or phone numbers for enquiries and support  
In reaching out to candidates, the Board publishes essential information/guidelines in the Brochure. The Brochure provides ca ndidates with 
detailed information on Programmes with their basi c and specific entry requirements leading to the award of First Degree, National Diploma, 
National Innovation Diploma and Nigeria Certificate in Education in Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria.

This is the Eighth (8th) edition for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Candidates are advised to study this Brochure thoroughly 
before completing the online application documents.   
I wish you success!
