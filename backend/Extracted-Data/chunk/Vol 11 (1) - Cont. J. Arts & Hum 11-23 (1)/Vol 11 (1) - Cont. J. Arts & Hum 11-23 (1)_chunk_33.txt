establishment of 
JAMB
, one would readily agree that the Federal 
Government
 
of Nigeria 
then had 
almost no option other than to s
et up the Board. There was heat in the body 
politic 
and the palpable tension generated by multiple admissions pitched the North 
again
st the South. This period coincid
ed with the period of North/South dichotomy and 
government wanted the problem solved once and for all hence the establishment of 
JAMB.

JAMB and harmonization of
 
admission processes
,
 
the hue and cry generated hitherto 
were doused albeit temporarily. The 
establishment
 
of 
more universities, especially in Northern Nigeria, also contributed in no small measure 
to 
allay the fears of domination of the North by the 
South 
educationally.
