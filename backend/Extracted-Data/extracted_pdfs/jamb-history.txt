Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board
(JAMB) is a Nigerian entrance examination board for
tertiary-level institutions.[1] The board conducts
Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination for
prospective undergraduates into Nigerian
universities.[2] The board is also charged with the
responsibility to administer similar examinations for
applicants to Nigerian public and private
monotechnics, polytechnics, and colleges of
educations. All of these candidates must have obtained
the West Africa Senior School Certificate (WASSCE)
conducted yearly by the West African Examinations
Council, WAEC, or its equivalent, National
Examination Council (Nigeria), Senior School
Certificate Examination, NECO SSCE.[3]
The pioneer registrar was Michael Saidu Angulu, who
served from inception in 1978 until 1986.[4] The
current registrar of JAMB is Prof Ishaq Oloyede, who
was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari in
August 2016.[5] Registration for 2024 UTME
commenced on 15 January 2024 and ended on 26
February 2024. The main examination is scheduled to
commence on 19 April and end on 29 April 2024,
while the optional Mock examination was held on 7
March 2024.[6]
Jamb CBT (Computer Based Test) Centres are the various locations and centres in Nigeria approved by
JAMB for the registration of the UTME examination. There are various JAMB CBT centers/locations in
the 36 states in Nigeria including the Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria), FCT.[7]
As of March 2024, there are a total of 793 Computer-Based Test centres across the country. [8]
Every year, the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board conducts one of the most credible examinations
in Nigeria that determines whether a student will be admitted to a tertiary institution of learning. A record
number of nearly 1.8 million candidates registered for the 2022 examination.[9]
CBT centres
Examinations
The Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination is only valid for a year, and has a score range 0–400. The
examination is a test of knowledge, speed and accuracy. It consists of 180 questions with a time frame of
2 hours (120 minutes). The subject combination[10] vary based on a candidate's desired course of study,
although English language is compulsory for all candidates.
The examination is conducted for international candidates who wish to be admitted into any Nigerian
tertiary institution by the West African Examination Council (WAEC).
After the conduct of the year's examination, the board sits and deliberates on the cut-off mark for
universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and 'monotechniques'. Often universities have the higher
cut-off mark, while other institutions require lower marks.[11]
In 2024 Jamb reduced it's cut off mark to 140 for private and public universities and 100 for polytechnics
and colleges of education.[12][13][14]
Jamb gives admission to students whose school of choice has already confirmed as fit and qualified for
admission. The only thing JAMB does is to confirm the admission and upload it on their portal then issue
out JAMB admission letters to the candidates.
The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board is yet to officially approve a certified CBT practice
platform for candidates. However, with growing concern over the performance of candidates in these
computer-based tests,[15] considering the fact that Nigeria is a developing country with a sizeable number
of school children having little to no access to computers & the internet,[16] a number of independent
contributors [17] have provided practice platforms with thousands of past questions to help candidates
prepare and boost their performance in the actual test.[18]
