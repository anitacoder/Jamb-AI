JAMB also has noticed the inability of candidates to a ccurately identify the appropriate requirements for various Programmes of Study before 
filling the JAMB application forms. Also, one of the major improvements this year is the  ability of candidates to ident ify eligibility for various 
Programmes by supplying either O’Level or A’Level results into the eligibility form online on the IBASS link available on the JAMB website.   
In summary, the 2020 JAMB BROCHURE has the following features for the benefits of candidates:  
1. Online and mobile app (android) version apart from the CD version of the JAMB Brochure  
2. An interactive Eligibility Checker to guide candidates on institutions and courses they are eligible to apply for using their O’level or A’level 
subjects and UTME subjects.  
3. CBT Exams guide and Demo Exams to guide candidates on the process on the exams.  
4. Exams Rules and Regulations  
5. Recommended books
