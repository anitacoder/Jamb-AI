Abstract
 
 
The establishment of tertiary institutions in Nigeria necessitated the setting up 
of entrance examin
ations into these schools. This becomes more understandable 
if one consi
ders the teeming population of youths seeking admission into these 
tertiary institutions. Hitherto, each institution used to conduct entrance 
examinations in line with their autonomous s
tatus. This process was called
 
concessional admission. It was in 1978 
that the Federal Government of Nigeria 
established the Joint Admission
s
 
Matriculation Board (JAMB) to harmonize 
admissions into tertiary institution
s in Nigeria. This paper undertook
 
a 
historical evaluation of JAMB’s efficiency in the conduct of entrance 
e
xaminations in Nigeria, 1978
-
2019. Historical descriptive design was adopted
.
 
Fifteen 
staff
,
 
applicants and students were sampled from fifteen tertiary 
institutions and their host communities in South Western geo
-
political zone of 
Nigeria. A structured que
stionnaire titled “Questionnaire on Historical 
Evaluation of JAMB Efficiency in the Conduct of Entrance Examinations in 
Nigeria” (QHEJECEEN) was used
. The data obtained were analyzed using
 
ANOVA
 
as the statistical tool
. It was revealed that examination mal
practices 
remain a formidable task before JAMB. In view of the foregoing
, it was 
recommended 
that the nation should urgently come to the rescue of JAMB to 
curb examination malpractices.

Introduction
 
 
Examination is a word that embellishes a lot of steps in one’s 
quest for knowledge or information. 
It has to do with questions, tests, assessments, evaluations
,
 
inquiries and so on. It is in line with 
the foregoing that the first examination in the world could be traced to the first five 
questions in 
the Bible.
 
The 
first was between 
Satan and the woman, and the last four were between God on 
the one 
hand and the c
ouple Adam and Eve
 
on the other. However, 
the first known examination 
in the world of human beings could be traced to 
1796 when Maskely
ne, not only observed but 
als
o recorded with the aid of tele
scope, the movement of stars in England (Agbama, 2019).

1833, improved on the works began by Maskelyne. However, it 
was not until 1884 that tests and 
measurements
 
of individuals started with the disc
overy of 
Sir 
Francis Galton in his laboratories (Agbama, 2019). The point must, however, be made that these 
early examinations were informal, oral and written as the case might be.
 
 
The Chinese were said to have been the first people to have applied informal 
examinations in written form in appointments into 
their civil service as
 
early as 2200 B.C
. 
Before 1815, the Americans were 
believed to have emp
loyed the use of series of 
achievem
ent tests in their educational and civil service systems (Agbam
a, 2019). A test 
called the Beri
et Simon intelli
gence test
 
was targ
eted at measuring the intelligen
ce of 
children while group te
st was first introduced in the years 
1914
-
1918 to test the 
intell
igence of soldiers (Agbama, 2019). Objective tests were developed in 1864 by George 
Fisher 
and in 1877, J.M. 
Rice 
introduced what has been known as the standard objective 
scale (Agbama, 2019).
 
 
It is quite logical
 
to
 
argue that the first formal examination 
known in Nigeria, without 
fear

f

contradictions;
 
came 
parri
 
passu
,
 
with the advent of w
estern education.
 
This 
perspective is more tenable if one considers the fact that transition from one level to 
another would have required a decision as to whether
 
the pupils had satisfied all the 
requirements for promotion or not. Such a decision would naturally come after a form of 
test, measurement, evaluation and or examination in the spirit of fair play. However, the 
first known examination body in Nig
eria is t
he West African Examination
 
Council 
(WAEC) which had first been established in the Gambia in 1951 and in 1952 its office was 
opened in Nigeria. 
(

, WAEC conducts examinations 
like the West African School Certificate 
Exam
ination (WASCE), General Certificate 
Examination 
(GCE), 
City 
and Guilds and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) Examination. 
 
 
Other examination bodies in Nigeria include the National Examination Council (NECO), 
National Business and 
Technical 
Examination
 
Board
 
(NABTEB), the 
International 
Centre 
for 
Educational
 
Evaluation (ICEE) and

made that all the other examination bodies aforementioned including WAEC, but 
excluding JAMB were so established to conduct terminal exa
minations in secondary and 
specialized
 
schools particularly with a view to preparing students for tertiary institutions. 
It was only JAMB that was founded to conduct entrance examinations into Universities 
in Nigeria and it is in this light that this paper
 
discusses the history of JAMB.
 
 
The years 1948, when the University College, Ibadan
,
 
was established
;
 
and 1978, when 
JAMB 
was established, witnessed a period when universities in Nigeria were allowed to 
control their admission without recourse to any 
external examination body (Anyawu, 
2016). The years following the civil war brought new developments into the 
educational 
landscape of Nigeria. The Gowon reg
ime wanted to use education 
as a tool for national 
re
-
birth and reconciliation. The point must be r
eiterated were that during the civil war, 
educational activities, in most cases were disrupted or actually paralyzed 
particularly
 
in 
Eastern Nig
eria. The population of the country was 
rapidly
 
increasing especially in 
post
-
civil 
war Nigeria and the teeming 
population of Nigerian youths were becoming 
increasingly ambitious and were vig
orously pursuing university educa
tion especially in 
the South.
 
Coupled with the foregoing is also the fact
 
that the nation needed s
killed 
manpower to harness and articulate the 
rehabilitation programmes of 
the Federal 
Government and so u
niversity education became highly sought after.
 
 
This period, however, co
i
ncided
 
with a time when the existing u
niver
sities could no 
longer satisfy the yearnings of youths seeking admission. This w
as occasioned by lack of 
facilities like classrooms, hostels, laboratories and personnel which concomitantly 
constrained the universities to limit the numbers of students admitted annually. Anyawu 
(2016) submitted that this period of low admission also saw
 
a period of imbalance in 
admission where the North continued to protest against the number of intakes 
vis
-
à
-
vis
 
the 
South
. Since each university was conducting 
its
 
admission on its own, another 
problem of multiple admission consequently arose. This was a 
situation when
;
 
because 
applicants were not sure if they would be offered admission by a particular university, 
applicants would now apply to 
different
 
u
niversities and would be offered admission by 
more than one. In such a situation, candidates so offered
 
admission by different 
universities 
would not reject such multiple admissions on time thereby preventing other 
candidates from being admitted (Anyawu, 2
016). Since the South embraced w
estern 
education earlier than the North, cases of multiple admissions, 
understandably, were 
more rampant in the South than the North. It was then argued by the North that the South 
was deliberately using multiple admissions to deprive its youths
 
from being admitted 
into 
universities
. Th
us this era of 
cut throat c
ompetition and mutual suspicion between 
the North and 
South that
 
characterized pre
-
civil war 
Nigeria,
 
was being re
-
awakened. 
Anyawu (2016) opined that all these culminated in increasing 
demands for the

introduction of quota 
system, establishment of federal
 
universities in all states and the 
establishment of state universities.
 
 
The Federal Government responded to this by removing university education from the 
Concurrent 
list to the 
Exclusive 
list through the instrumentality of the 1972 Declaration 
which surr
eptitiously amended the 1963 Republican Constitution (Anyawu, 2016). The 
meaning of the foregoing is that only the Federal Government of Nigeria could establish 
and own universities. University admission and by extension, education became the 
exclusive res
ponsibility of the federal government alone. Secondly in addition to the 
existing six universities
,
 
the federal government established seven more making the 
number to be thirteen before 1978. Finally, the federal government set up a committee 
known as
 
the
 
Committee on University Entrance (CUE) headed by M.S. Angulu to advice 
government
,
 
inter
-
alia
, on how to solve issues generated by university admission in 
Nigeria (Anyawu, 2016). It was this committee that recommended among other things 
the establishment o
f the 
Universities Central Admission 
Board whi
ch 
metamorphiz
ed
 
into JAMB in 1978 (Anyawu, 2016).
 
 
Having established 
the foregoing point
,
 
it is quite pertinent to examine the formative 
years of JAMB’s existence with a view to understanding how it has fared 
in carrying out 
the mandate given to it. JAMB (2019
a
) noted that JAMB 
was established by Decree No. 2 
of 1978 as amended by Decree No 33 o
f 1989. The
s
e
 
decrees em
powered JAMB, 
inter
-
alia
,
 
to conduct matriculation examinations into all 
Universities
, 
Polytechnics 
and 
Colleges 
of 
Education in Nigeria
.
 
In 
order to achieve the foregoing mandate JAMB was further 
empowered to appoint all personnel like examiners, invigilators,
 
moderators and other 
personnel
 
it considered necessary in the conduct of its exam
inations. Moreover, JAMB 
was also enabled by these decrees to admit candidates who have been adjudged to have 
satisfied all requirements for admission into tertiary institutions in Nigeria (JAMB, 
2019
a
). JAMB Act (2019
b
) submitted that the enabling decrees
 
establishing JAMB also 
defined
, among other things,
 
membership of the Board
,
 
tenure of office of Board 
members
,
 
removal from office of 
Board 
members
,
 
ministerial power over the 
Board, 
other 
staff of the 
Board, 
fund of the 
Board,
 
expenditure of t
he Board
.
 
 
Ukoba (2017) opined that JAMB prior to 2014, was conducting two different examinations 
into higher institutions in Nigeria. One was the University Matriculation Examination 
(UME) and the other was the Monotechnics, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education 
Ex
aminations (MPCE). It 
was,
 
however
,
 
in 2010 that JAMB harmonized the two 
examinations 
and so the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) was born. 
This was apparently done to save cost and
 
time and at the same time, it gav
e equal 
opportunities fo
r all candidates seeking admission into tertiar
y institutions in Nigeria.

Then
 
the paper and pencil test (PPT) was
 
in vogue but now a computer bas
ed te
st (CBT) 
which i
s a computer based standardized test had been introduced. The duration of each 
examinatio
n was 
two hours forty
-
five minutes with a grade range of 0
-
400 and a validity 
period of one year. It must also 
be observed that JAMB conducted its examinations only 
once a year. 
 
 
JAMB (2019
c
) observed that the introduction of biometric data capture for sta
ff of the 
Board and can
didates seeking admission 
went a long way to check examination 
malpractices and also to monitor the movement of staff. Coupled with the foregoing, the 
Board also went digital with supply of computers to staff
.
 
All
 
these culminated in 
timely 
release of examinations’ results within two weeks 
instead of within two or three months 
as was the practice. Lawal (2019) opined 
that
 
JAMB had been un
-
relenting in checking 
examination malpractices in all its centres nationwide.
 
There are laid down rules and 
procedures to be met by these centres and any contravention attracted stiff penalties
; as 
it was the case in 2019, w
hen JAMB banned
 
on
e hundred of its centres
 
nationwide
 
for 
committing various examination offences. JAMB (2019
d
) noted that one of the many ways 
by which the 
Board 
had been assisting candidates to ease their yearly burden of obtaining 
admi
ssion into higher institutions of their choice was the provision of an online support 
system known as the 
Central Online Suppor
t System 
(COSS)
.
 
This
 
included 
Candidate
/General 
Support 
Ticket, 
Development Partners 
and 
Centre Support 
and 
Local 
Support
.
 
 
To buttress the point that paucity of funds was not one of the many
 
challenges bedeviling 
JAMB, 
according to (Nwafor, 20
17) 
whereas
 
between 2010 and 2016, the total amount of 
money remitted to the 
federal government 
by JAMB was 5 million 
Naira
,
 
it rose to 7.8 
billion 
Naira 
in 2017 alone. That JAMB had, not only adopted technology but had 
entrenched 
it
 
is no longer in doubt. I
redia (201
9) had noted that th
e JAMB Registra
r
, 
through the use of technology, could kno
w
 
when a candidate registers, the exact time of 
registration
,
 
the system used to register the
 
candidate as
 
well as the exact location 
of the 
registration centre. Ired
ia (2019) ad
ded that 
biometric 
veri
fication of candidates was a 
maj
or 
achievement
 
of the Board which had gone a long 
way in checking impersonation 
at
 
examination centres.
 
 
In spite of these daunting achievements by JAMB, the task of conducting examinations 
into all the tertiary institutions in Nigeria with the teeming population of her 
youths
 
is 
rather 
Herculean 
(Rotimi, 2015). The introduction of U.T.M.E
.
 
had made a mockery
 
of the 
fact that admission requirements into Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of 
Edu
cation are different. By harmonizing matriculation examinations of
 
these i
nstitutions

the objectives of th
e founders of these different
 
institutions
 
had thus been d
efeated
 
(Rotimi
, 2015).
 
 
Sylvester (2016) noted that screening of candidates into universities after writing 
JAMB 
examinations began when cases of examination malpractices became rampant. In order 
to further examine candidates before being admitted, in
stitu
tions now introduced 
screen
ing tests for candidates 
and this
 
is now known as post U.T.M.E
.
 
The 
foregoing is 
further 
buttressed
 
by the point that a correlation had not been made between higher 
JAMB scores and better performance of students during their 100 
level, whereas a 
correlation was established between higher 
Senior Secondary Certificate Examination 
(SSC
E) scores and students performance in higher schools (Lawal, 2016). The minimum 
cut off marks for admissions into Univ
ersities, Polytechn
ics Colleges o
f Education range
 
between 100
 
-
160 (Bamigbola, 2019). The implication of the foregoing is that any 
candidate who secured admission into any higher institution in Nigeria with 100 marks 
or 25% of the total marks obtainable or 160 marks or 40% had actually p
erformed below 
average (Rotimi, 2015)
.
 
Most 
institutions
,
 
whether public or private
,
 
now admit students 
who had performed dismally in entrance examinations.
 
 
Statement of the Problem
s
 
Multiple admissions had deprived many Nigerian youths admission into higher 
institutions and the North was mostly affected. In order to solve this problem the Federal 
Government of Nigeria established JAMB to conduct matriculation examinations into 
tertiar
y 
institutions
 
in
 
Nigeria.
 
 
Purpose of the Study
 
JAMB had been the sole body conducting entrance examinations into higher institutions 
in Nigeria since 1978. 
However, there are constraints o
n the performance of this task as 
there are many higher institutio
ns in Nigeria and given the sheer size of the nation’s 
population of admission 
seekers every year. Coupled with the foregoing is the fact that 
standards are being lowered yearly as a progre
ssive reduction in cut
-
off mark
s was 
observed
. This paper, therefor
e, evaluates the history and efficiency of JAMB in 
conducting matriculation examinations into higher institutions in Nigeria.
 
 
Hypothesis 
 
Ho1:
 
There is no significant difference between efficiency of JAMB and admission of 
candidates with low grades.
 
 
Ho2: T
here is no significant difference between
 
the
 
efficiency of JAMB and post U.T.M.E.

Methodology
 
 
Historical descriptive survey research design was used which necessitated a structured 
questionnaire. The 
title of the 
structured questionnaire is “QHEJECEEN”. 
Sampled 
respondents
 
were selected with descriptive sampling technique. Fifteen staff, applicants 
and students were sampled from fifteen higher institutions and their host
 
communities 
in South
-
Western Nigeria making a total of 225 respondents. A ten item qu
estionnaire 
was designed on the subject. The questionnaire is close
 
-
 
ended which included Yes or 
No options. The data collected was analyzed with ANOVA as the statistical tool. 
“QHEJECEEN” was validated by two 
Principal 
Lecturers of the 
School 
of 
Secondar
y 
Education (Arts and Social Sciences)
 
of
 
The 
College of Education, Lanlate and two
 
Senior 
Lecturers 
of the Department of 
History
, University of Ibadan. T
-
test was also used to test 
internal validity and the reliability co
-
efficient of 0.81 was established
 
which
 
was
 
reliable 
enough to carry out the research. 
 
 
Discussion of Results
 
 
Ho
1:
 
The
re is no significant difference
 
between the efficiency of JAMB and the 
admission of students with low grades.
 
 
The 
first hypothesis that says 
there is no significant difference between the efficiency of 
JAMB and the admission of students with low grades is rejected
 
as shown on Table
s
 
1 
and 
2
 
. The implication of the rejection of this null hypothesis
 
is
 
that if JAMB is truly 
efficient,
 
admission of students with low grades would not have been allowed in the first 
instance as this would ultimately affect students
’
 
performance when eventually 
admitted.

This i
s an agreement with (Rotimi,
 
2015
) when it was asserted that tertiary institution
s in 
Nigeria admit candidates with as low as between 25% and 40% of the total marks 
obtainable in matriculation examinations conducted by JAMB. It then means that 
students being admitted into higher
 
institutions in Nigeria
 
are below average.

The second null hypothesis that says there is no significant difference between efficiency 
of JAMB and the introduction of post U.T.M.E
.
 
in tertiary institutions in Nigeria is 
rejected
 
as shown on Table 1 as well as ANOVA
 
in
 
Table 2
. What the foregoing means is 
that if JAMB is really efficient in carrying out its mandate, there would not have been any 
need for higher institutions to conduct separate screening of candidates seeking 
admission as epitomized in the 
post
 
U.T.M.E
.
 
Failure 
of JAMB in addressing lapses in the 
admission process
es, therefore,
 
led to post U.T.M.E.
 
 
This is in tandem with the assertion of (Sylvester, 2016) that higher 
institutions
 
in Nigeria 
began to conduct post U
.
T
.
M
.
E
.
 
wh
en the conduct of matriculation examina
tions
 
by 
JAMB became riddled wi
th
 
malpractices.
 
 
Conclusion and 
Recommendations
 
 
A historical evaluation of JAMB and its efficiency in
 
the
 
educational
 
development of 
Nigeria was carried out and the study covered the years between 1978, when the Board 
was es
tablished and 2019, the current year. Looking at the events surrounding the 
establishment of 
JAMB
, one would readily agree that the Federal 
Government
 
of Nigeria 
then had 
almost no option other than to s
et up the Board. There was heat in the body 
politic 
and the palpable tension generated by multiple admissions pitched the North 
again
st the South. This period coincid
ed with the period of North/South dichotomy and 
government wanted the problem solved once and for all hence the establishment of 
JAMB.
 
 
Admitte
dly with the establishment of
 
JAMB and harmonization of
 
admission processes
,
 
the hue and cry generated hitherto 
were doused albeit temporarily. The 
establishment
 
of 
more universities, especially in Northern Nigeria, also contributed in no small measure 
to 
allay the fears of domination of the North by the 
South 
educationally.

JAMB had done a lot in conducting matriculation examinations into higher institutions
 
in Nigeria. Not only had it digitalized its operations, it had also pleasantly surprised 
Nigerians
 
by releasing its results with
in
 
the shortest 
possible time. The Board had also 
shown serious commitment towards checking examination malpractices by descending 
heavily on perpetrators of such dastardly acts. All these were efforts 
aimed at lend
ing 
credibi
lity
 
to its examinations. 
 
 
However, higher institutions had shown that Jamb was not effi
ci
ent in carrying out its 
mandate by introducing the post U.T.M.E
.
 
The 
post 
U.T.M.E.,
 
therefore
,
 
is a
 
tacit
 
rejection 
of JAMB’s matriculation examinations which is aki
n to a vote of no confidence.
 
 
Interestingly enough; the North that had inadvertently contributed immensely to the 
establishment of 
JAMB 
with the belief that 
universities 
were discriminating against
 
northern candidates, still, up till now, do not have as m
any students in 
universities 
as the 
south does. This is better understood when one considers the fact that the quota system, 
when introduced, was principally aimed at providing admission opportunities for 
applicants from the less 
privileged
 
areas especiall
y the North.
 
Anyawu (2016) submitted 
that in 1978/79 a
cademic session
,
 
for instance, a total of 113, 162 candidates applied to 
different universities in
 
Nigeria
.
 
Out
 
of this figure, applicants from the North were less 
than 20,000
. Of
 
the total number
 
that applied for admission
, only 14,417 students or 12% 
were admitted altogether with the 
South 
having 11,641 and the North
 
having 2,776. 
Unfortunately the trend continues till today.
 
 
It is in view of all the foregoing that the paper recommended that 
JAM
B
, as presently 
constituted
,
 
should be un
-
bundled and de
-
centralized. Nigeria is a large country both in
 
te
r
ms of land mass and population with her youths seeking admission contributing a big 
chunk of the nation’s population. For a single body to effective
ly carry out the 
responsibility of conducting matriculation examinations for all the tertiary institutions in 
the whole country is rather herculean indeed.
 
 
 
Nigeria is 
a
 
heterogeneous
 
nation and there is no gainsaying the fact that higher 
institutions wer
e founded, 
inter
-
alia
, to stimulate the growth and development of their 
host communities. If the input of individual institutions is not factorized in admission 
processes, it would affect the quality of intakes and thus compromise the aims and 
objectives o
f the founding fathers in establishing such an institution. It is thus suggested 
that each 
institution
 
should be allowed a large measure of 
autonomy
 
in its admission 
processes.

In recent years, the Federal Government had been taking steps to stop tertiary
 
institutions 
from conducting post U.T.M.E
.
, although it has not been implemented with the political 
will it deserves. Instead of doing this govern
ment should empower tertiary institutions 
in the conduct of local matriculation examinations.
 
 
JAMB
 
should
 
also take urgent steps to reinvigorate credibility and integrity in its 
examinations by checkmating examination malpractices. It is quite evident that giant 
strides have been made in this direction. The ban placed on 100 CBT centres, discussed 
elsewh
ere in
 
this paper, is a good cas
e in point. However, more could still be done in this 
direction
 
and all stakeholders in the education sector should come to the assistance of the 
Board to so
lve this multi
-
facetted problem 
not only
 
of
 
JAMB but of the whole nation 
as a 
whole.
 
 
Government is apparently in a 
dilemma
 
amidst calls for the un
-
bundling of JAMB. The 
reason is not far
-
fetched as the body language of the North does not favour such a 
dramatic step. 
The apprehension is quite under
sta
nda
ble in view of the yawni
ng gap 
between the North and the South in the area of population of youths in higher institutions 
of learning. This problem could be solved from the primary and 
secondary
 
schools levels. 
The preponderance of out of school children is higher in the North 
vi
s
-
à
-
vis
 
the South. If 
the gap would be bridged at the top, the best place to start is from the lower levels.
