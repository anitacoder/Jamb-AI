Introduction
 
 
Examination is a word that embellishes a lot of steps in one’s 
quest for knowledge or information. 
It has to do with questions, tests, assessments, evaluations
,
 
inquiries and so on. It is in line with 
the foregoing that the first examination in the world could be traced to the first five 
questions in 
the Bible.
 
The 
first was between 
Satan and the woman, and the last four were between God on 
the one 
hand and the c
ouple Adam and Eve
 
on the other. However, 
the first known examination 
in the world of human beings could be traced to 
1796 when Maskely
ne, not only observed but 
als
o recorded with the aid of tele
scope, the movement of stars in England (Agbama, 2019).
