Anyawu (2016) submitted 
that in 1978/79 a
cademic session
,
 
for instance, a total of 113, 162 candidates applied to 
different universities in
 
Nigeria
.
 
Out
 
of this figure, applicants from the North were less 
than 20,000
. Of
 
the total number
 
that applied for admission
, only 14,417 students or 12% 
were admitted altogether with the 
South 
having 11,641 and the North
 
having 2,776. 
Unfortunately the trend continues till today.
 
 
It is in view of all the foregoing that the paper recommended that 
JAM
B
, as presently 
constituted
,
 
should be un
-
bundled and de
-
centralized. Nigeria is a large country both in
 
te
r
ms of land mass and population with her youths seeking admission contributing a big 
chunk of the nationâ€™s population. For a single body to effective
ly carry out the 
responsibility of conducting matriculation examinations for all the tertiary institutions in 
the whole country is rather herculean indeed.
