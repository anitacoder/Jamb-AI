ing tests for candidates 
and this
 
is now known as post U.T.M.E
.
 
The 
foregoing is 
further 
buttressed
 
by the point that a correlation had not been made between higher 
JAMB scores and better performance of students during their 100 
level, whereas a 
correlation was established between higher 
Senior Secondary Certificate Examination 
(SSC
E) scores and students performance in higher schools (Lawal, 2016). The minimum 
cut off marks for admissions into Univ
ersities, Polytechn
ics Colleges o
f Education range
 
between 100
 
-
160 (Bamigbola, 2019). The implication of the foregoing is that any 
candidate who secured admission into any higher institution in Nigeria with 100 marks 
or 25% of the total marks obtainable or 160 marks or 40% had actually p
erformed below 
average (Rotimi, 2015)
.
 
Most 
institutions
,
 
whether public or private
,
 
now admit students 
who had performed dismally in entrance examinations.
