Discussion of Results
 
 
Ho
1:
 
The
re is no significant difference
 
between the efficiency of JAMB and the 
admission of students with low grades.
 
 
The 
first hypothesis that says 
there is no significant difference between the efficiency of 
JAMB and the admission of students with low grades is rejected
 
as shown on Table
s
 
1 
and 
2
 
. The implication of the rejection of this null hypothesis
 
is
 
that if JAMB is truly 
efficient,
 
admission of students with low grades would not have been allowed in the first 
instance as this would ultimately affect students
â€™
 
performance when eventually 
admitted.
