PREFACE                      
Since the conduct of the first Matriculation examination for entry into all Degree -awarding Institutions in 1978,  Colleges of Education in 1988, 
Colleges of Education & Polytechnics 1989, Monotechnics in 1998 and Innovation Enterprises Institutions in 2009 , the board has come a long way. 
The vision which foresaw that there would be a major increase in the number of applicants and the ability of each institution to handle admissions 
on its own soon became a reality as almost 40 years on, the numbers have reached a staggering 2 million applicants yearly. Surely the largest single 
application process for entry into educational institutions in the world since larger nations have regionalized the process.
