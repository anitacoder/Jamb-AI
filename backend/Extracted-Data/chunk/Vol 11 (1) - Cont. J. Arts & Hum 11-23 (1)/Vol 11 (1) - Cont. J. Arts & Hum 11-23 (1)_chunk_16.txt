Ukoba (2017) opined that JAMB prior to 2014, was conducting two different examinations 
into higher institutions in Nigeria. One was the University Matriculation Examination 
(UME) and the other was the Monotechnics, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education 
Ex
aminations (MPCE). It 
was,
 
however
,
 
in 2010 that JAMB harmonized the two 
examinations 
and so the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) was born. 
This was apparently done to save cost and
 
time and at the same time, it gav
e equal 
opportunities fo
r all candidates seeking admission into tertiar
y institutions in Nigeria.
