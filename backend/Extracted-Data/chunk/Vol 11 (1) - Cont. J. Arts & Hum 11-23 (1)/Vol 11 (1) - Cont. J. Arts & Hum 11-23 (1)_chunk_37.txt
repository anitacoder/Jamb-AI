ly carry out the 
responsibility of conducting matriculation examinations for all the tertiary institutions in 
the whole country is rather herculean indeed.
 
 
 
Nigeria is 
a
 
heterogeneous
 
nation and there is no gainsaying the fact that higher 
institutions wer
e founded, 
inter
-
alia
, to stimulate the growth and development of their 
host communities. If the input of individual institutions is not factorized in admission 
processes, it would affect the quality of intakes and thus compromise the aims and 
objectives o
f the founding fathers in establishing such an institution. It is thus suggested 
that each 
institution
 
should be allowed a large measure of 
autonomy
 
in its admission 
processes.
